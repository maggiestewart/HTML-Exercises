# HTML-Exercises

For my Cloud & Web Programming class, we are reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS by creating a simple website that includes the following. We are also using Amazon AWS services to create an EC2 instance and also deploy our websites/updates onto it.
- Images
- Lists
- Audio / Video files
- Embedded links (Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Slides documents)
- Tables
- Styling in the head tag

Each file will be an update on the progress of the website as each exercise builds upon the next
