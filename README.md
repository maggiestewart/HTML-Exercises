# HTML-Exercises

For my Cloud & Web Programming class, we are reviewing the basics of HTML by creating a simple website that includes

- Lists
- Audio / Video files
- Embedded links (Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Slides documents)
- Tables

Each file will be an update on the progress of the website as each exercise builds upon the next
